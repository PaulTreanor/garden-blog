Search engines operate on huge datasets and the cost of crawling is
significant especially when content is changing infrequently. Organic
discovery of new content through crawling is therefore slow. Pages
and sitemaps are revisited infrequently leading to a lag between the
posting of new content and its inclusion in search engine indices.

All parties involved in the search engine experience benefit from a better
model for updating search engine indices. Pushing notifications of content
change in real time to search engines allows them to optimize their effort
when crawling on updated content when most content on the web changes
infrequently. Users of search engines receive search results with content
that is both updated and more relevant. Site owners avoid the cost of frequent
crawling of their sites and benefit from their most recent content being
presented to users in a more timely way.

To support this model, most engines now offer a
custom API for site owners to programmatically push notifications of content
updates, deleted URLs and new URLs that should be prioritized for crawls
and subsequent indexing. For example, Google offers the
[Indexing API](https://developers.google.com/search/apis/indexing-api/v3/quickstart)
and Microsoft offers the
[Submission API](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/url-submission-api#APIs).
The challenge with the vendor specific API model is that each engine's API implementation
differs as does its authentication and authorization mechanism. This forces
developers to create code for each engine.

[IndexNow](https://www.indexnow.org/) seeks to resolve the vendor specific
notification API challenge by offering a unified interface and common site
ownership verification mechanism. This allows developers to write a single
set of code to update multiple engines. The project is currently backed by
[Microsoft Bing](https://www.bing.com).

> Without IndexNow, it can take days to weeks for search engines to discover
> that the content has changed, as search engines donâ€™t crawl every URL often.
> With IndexNow, search engines know immediately the "URLs that have changed,
> helping them prioritize crawl for these URLs and thereby limiting organic
> crawling to discover new content."

This article covers an integration with [IndexNow](https://www.indexnow.org/)
through [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
using a shell script to update the
[Microsoft Bing](https://www.bing.com) search engine with updated
URLs in this blog implementation upon each deployment of the site.

The evolving **GitHub repository** storing this blog and its implementation can be
found [here](https://github.com/jpfulton/blog).

## Getting Started with Bing and Bing Webmaster Tools

[Bing Webmaster Tools](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/) is the portal
for establishing site ownership with Bing and managing URL submission,
tracking search performance and managing search engine optimization.
I observed a number of quirks when running the webmaster tools portal in
both Chrome and Safari. Those quirks can be avoided by utilizing
[Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/) when running the
portal.

If you are already a verified owner of one or more sites with Google, it is possible
to import your properties and verified ownership direct into Bing via an exchange
with [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/). Other methods
for verifying site ownership are also available.

## Creating and Hosting the API Key

The first step in using the IndexNow API is to generate, and then host in a
[text file](https://github.com/jpfulton/blog/blob/main/static/8846484b349642449a66629f496422f8.txt),
an API key to prove ownership of a given site. The file should be named after the
key with the extension `.txt` and contain a single line with the key as its
contents. While they key may be generated in a number of ways, it must be at least
eight characters long. The Bing engine provides a
[useful generator](https://www.bing.com/indexnow) with a mechanism to download the
host file.

In a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) site, the key file may be placed
in the `/static` folder and will
be added to the root of the generated site during a production build.

## Structure of an IndexNow Request

The body of an IndexNow request is a simple JSON object. It contains only four
properties: the host, api key, hosted key file location and a list of URLs.
In the case of Bing, it may be submitted using an HTTP `POST` to
`https://www.bing.com/indexnow`. It is important to set the `Content-Type` header
to `application/json; charset=utf-8` for the request to be accepted by the API.

```json
POST /IndexNow HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Host: www.bing.com
{
  "host": "www.jpatrickfulton.dev",
  "key": "8846484b349642449a66629f496422f8",
  "keyLocation": "https://www.jpatrickfulton.dev/8846484b349642449a66629f496422f8.txt",
  "urlList": [
    "https://www.jpatrickfulton.dev/",
    "https://www.jpatrickfulton.dev/blog/2023-06-23-samba-and-timemachine/",

    ]
}
```

## Building and Submitting the Request via a Bash Shell Script

The URL structure of a generated [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) site can be
derived from the structure of
the code that builds it. Therefore, a script that uses the structure of
the repository as its source material can be created that builds the URLs
of the pages that were generated is easy to create. Additionally, the
JSON structure of an IndexNow request body is straight forward so creating
it in a shell script is possible with a series of `echo` commands directed
to a local working file. Once the temporary working file containing the JSON
request is created, `curl` can be used to submit the request to the IndexNow API.

```sh:title=indexnow.sh {numberLines:true}
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Configurable variables used in IndexNow call and URL construction
HOST="www.jpatrickfulton.dev"
BASE_URL="https://${HOST}"
BING_API_KEY="8846484b349642449a66629f496422f8"
BING_URL_TO_KEY_FILE="${BASE_URL}/${BING_API_KEY}.txt"
BING_URL="https://www.bing.com"

BLOG_DIR=../../../content/blog/; # Location of /content/blog/ folder relative to tmp working dir

WORKING_DIR=$( pwd; );
TMP_DIR=$WORKING_DIR"/tmp";
JSON_FILE=body.json;

# Create and enter the working directory if it does not exist
if [ ! -d $TMP_DIR ]
  then
    echo "Creating temporary working directory.";
    mkdir $TMP_DIR;
fi
cd $TMP_DIR;

echo "Building POST body from repository structure.";
if [ -f $JSON_FILE ]
  then
    rm $JSON_FILE;
fi

# Begin JSON body construction
touch $JSON_FILE;
echo "{" >> $JSON_FILE;
echo "  \"host\": \"${HOST}\"," >> $JSON_FILE;
echo "  \"key\": \"${BING_API_KEY}\"," >> $JSON_FILE;
echo "  \"keyLocation\": \"${BING_URL_TO_KEY_FILE}\"," >> $JSON_FILE;
echo "  \"urlList\": [" >> $JSON_FILE;

# Add the root URL
echo "    \"${BASE_URL}/\"," >> $JSON_FILE;

# Iterate over folders in the /content/blog/ directory
# to create links to each individual generated blog page
BLOGS=($(ls $BLOG_DIR));
for BLOG in "${BLOGS[@]}"
do
  echo "    \"${BASE_URL}/blog/${BLOG}/\"," >> $JSON_FILE;
done

echo "    ]" >> $JSON_FILE;
echo "}" >> $JSON_FILE;
# JSON body constrction complete

echo "JSON POST body contents:";
cat $JSON_FILE;
echo;

echo "---";
echo "Updating Bing through POST to /IndexNow...";
echo;

# Use curl to POST the JSON content to Bing IndexNow endpoint
curl ${BING_URL}/IndexNow \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
  -d "$(cat $JSON_FILE)" \
  -s \
  -i;

echo "---";
echo "Done.";
```

## The GitHub Actions Workflow Step

In the continuous integration workflow for this site, I added a step
to the primary job following the step that builds and deploys the
generated output of site to [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com). The step is
configured to _only_ run for pushes to the default branch to ensure that it
only executes following production releases.

By default, GitHub Actions workflows run in a fairly restrictive user context.
The script above performs a number of operations that require elevated
permissions to perform in that space like creating a working directory
and files within it. As a result, the script must run in `sudo` mode to
work correctly. Per the
[GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#administrative-privileges),
a passwordless sudo mode is available in the workflow context which makes
executing the script fairly painless.

> The Linux and macOS virtual machines both run using passwordless sudo.
> When you need to execute commands or install tools that require more privileges
> than the current user, you can use sudo without needing to provide a password.

```yaml {5}{numberLines: true}
- name: Update Bing via IndexNow
  if: github.event_name == 'push'
  working-directory: ".github/scripts"
  shell: bash
  run: sudo ./indexnow.sh
```
