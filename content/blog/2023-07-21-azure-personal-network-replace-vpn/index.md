In an <Link to="/blog/2023-07-19-azure-personal-network-vpn-gateway/">earlier post</Link>,
we created an
[Azure VPN Gateway](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/vpn-gateway)
to provide remote access to our virtual network. While powerful, these resources
are both expensive at an SKU that supports multiple platforms and are likely overkill
as a solution for small business networks. They may are best suited for enterprise
deployments. In this post, we will create a
[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com)
virtual machine that supports similar functionality at a lower price point.

## Create a Virtual Machine

Firstly, we need to create a virtual machine attached to our existing
virtual network and in the resource group to host the OpenVPN tunnel.
From the Azure portal, navigate to the resource group and select
**Create** from the toolbar. Search for **virtual machine** in the Marketplace
and select **Create**.

On the create virtual machine screen, provide a name for the server, select
`Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS` as the image and select `Standard_B2s` as the
size. Supply an initial username and then select **Next: Disks**.

![Create Virtual Machine](./openvpn-server/create-vm.png)

On the disks step, change the `OS Disk Type` to
`Standard HDD (locally-redundant storage)`. Move on to the networking step.

![Create Virtual Machine Step 2](./openvpn-server/create-vm-2.png)

On the networking step, select the virtual network resource and ensure
a new public IP address is created for the NIC. Move on to the management
step.

![Create Virtual Machine Step 3](./openvpn-server/create-vm-3.png)

From the management step, select the `Login with Azure AD` checkbox
and then select **Review + create** to validate and complete the deployment.
The PEM file will be downloaded at the start of the process.

![Create Virtual Machine Step 4](./openvpn-server/create-vm-4.png)

## Configure the Virtual Machine

### Login via SSH using the PEM File

Move the PEM file downloaded during the deployment to your `~/.ssh` folder
and use it to log into the newly created server. The username must match
the one you selected during the virtual machine creation process and the private
IP may be found on the **Networking** tab on the newly created virtual machine
in the portal.

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/ubuntu-vpn-server_key.pem username@10.10.0.5
```

### Update all Packages

Update the packages from the base image using the following commands.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt list --upgradeable
sudo apt upgrade
```

### Set up Local Firewall

Next, we need to set up the local firewall. Neither the on-premise network
nor the virtual network use IPv6. As a result, we should disable IPv6 on
the firewall using the following this
[guide](https://tecadmin.net/setup-ufw-for-firewall-on-ubuntu-and-debian/).

Set up a rule to allow ssh and enable the firewall with the following
commands.

```bash {outputLines: 2-3, 5-6, 8-12}
sudo ufw allow ssh
port 22
Rules updated
sudo ufw enable
Command may disrupt existing ssh connections. Proceed with operation (y|n)? y
Firewall is active and enabled on system startup
sudo ufw status numbered
Status: active

     To                         Action      From
     --                         ------      ----
[ 1] 22/tcp                     ALLOW IN    Anywhere
```

Note that the Azure NSG will prevent access to ssh from the public IP.
This is particularly useful for quickly enabling external access by modifying the
NSG in a pinch.

### Install the OpenVPN and Easy-RSA Packages

Use the package manager to install the `openvpn` and `easy-rsa` packages.
The `easy-rsa` package will be used for generating keys for the tunnel.

```bash
sudo apt install openvpn easy-rsa
```

### Generate Certificates and Keys

The first step is to copy the `easy-rsa` scripts to the `/etc/openvpn`
folder and create a certificate authority folder.

```bash
sudo make-cadir /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa
```

Enter an interactive shell as root for the following steps with
this command.

```bash
sudo -s
```

Navigate to the `/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa` folder. The following commands
initialize the public key infrastructure and generates a certificate
authority that will be used to sign subsequent public / private key pairs.

```bash
cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa
./easyrsa init-pki
./easyrsa build-ca
```

Next, we need to create a set of
[Diffie Hellman parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffieâ€“Hellman_key_exchange)
to be used by the server.

```bash
./easyrsa gen-dh
```

Finally, we generate a certificate for the the server and sign it
with the certificate authority.

```bash
./easyrsa gen-req ubuntu-vpn-server nopass
./easyrsa sign-req server ubuntu-vpn-server
```

Copy the outputs of the previous command to the `/etc/openvpn` folder
where they will be used in the OpenVPN server configuration file.

```bash
cp pki/dh.pem pki/ca.crt pki/issued/ubuntu-vpn-server.crt pki/private/ubuntu-vpn-server.key /etc/openvpn/
```

With the server certificates and Diffie Hellman parameters ready for the
server configuration, we need to create a certificate for the client. Ideally,
each OpenVPN client will use a separate certificate to allow them to be
identified by the server and also revoked if needed. The outputs from
these commands will be used in
a separate step when creating the client
configuration file.

```bash
./easyrsa gen-req home-client nopass
./easyrsa sign-req client home-client
```

Exit the interactive shell.

```bash
exit
```

The last secret needed for the OpenVPN configuration is a
TLS authorization key. This key will be used in
[TLS authentication](https://openvpn.net/community-resources/hardening-openvpn-security/)
where it will participate in the creation of an
[HMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC) signature for all SSL/TLS
handshake packets to mitigate DoS attacks against the server.
That secret is generated with the following commands.

```bash
cd /etc/openvpn
sudo openvpn --genkey secret ta.key
```

### Configure the Server

In an effort to replace the Azure Virtual Network Gateway with a solution
of similar cryptographic strength and features, I endeavored to use many
equivalent features of OpenVPN in this implementation.

- `HMAC` packet signature validation using a pre-shared key and `SHA256` hashing
- `AES-256-GCM` data channel cipher
- Disallow reuse of client certificates
- Drop to unprivileged execution context following initialization

The primary difference between this OpenVPN configuration and the configuration
used by the Azure Virtual Network Gateway is that this configuration operates
on `UDP` rather than `TCP`.

#### Create the OpenVPN Server Configuration File

Create a server configuration file based on this example in
`/etc/openvpn` folder. Line 1 needs to be configured to represent the
subnet on which VPN clients will receive their IP addresses. Line 29 requires
configuration to match the address space of the Azure virtual network.

```sh:title=/etc/openvpn/homeserver.conf {1,29}{numberLines: true}
server 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0
topology subnet

proto udp
port 1194
dev tun

auth SHA256
cipher AES-256-GCM

ca ca.crt
cert server.crt
key server.key  # This file should be kept secret
dh dh.pem
tls-auth ta.key 0 # This file should be kept secret

;duplicate-cn # Uncomment to allow multiple clients using the same cert for debugging
keepalive 10 120
max-clients 5
explicit-exit-notify 1

persist-key
persist-tun

user nobody
group nogroup

# Push a route to the virtual network address space
push "route 10.10.0.0 255.255.0.0"

# Push the internal Azure virtual network DNS server
push "route 168.63.129.16 255.255.255.255"
push "dhcp-option DNS 168.63.129.16"

status /var/log/openvpn/openvpn-status.log
verb 3
```

A current version of this configuration file is available
[here](https://github.com/jpfulton/example-linux-configs/blob/main/etc/openvpn/server.conf).

#### Start the OpenVPN Service

Once the server configuration is in place, the OpenVPN service may be
started. Note the syntax of the start parameter. `systemctl` supports
multiple `openvpn` daemon configurations that may be started and stopped
independently using the syntax `openvpn@configuration-name`.

```bash
sudo systemctl start openvpn@homeserver
sudo systemctl status openvpn@homeserver
```

The `systemd` journal can be then be checked using the following
command.

```bash
sudo journalctl -u openvpn@homeserver -xe
```

#### Create a DNS Entry for the Server Public IP

Using the Azure portal, we can associate a domain name with the public IP
address used by the VPN server. These DNS names come in the form of
`*.region.cloudapp.azure.com`. Following creation of a DNS label for the public
IP, we can easily create a `CNAME` record to point to it from a custom domain
and use this in our client configuration file.

To create a DNS label, navigate to the public IP resource and select
**Settings** > **Configuration** to set the DNS label.

#### Configure the Local Server Firewall

The local firewall needs to be updated to both allow incoming
traffic on the OpenVPN UDP port and to masquerade traffic coming
from the tunnel into the virtual network.

Enable incoming traffic to the OpenVPN daemon with the following
commands.

```bash {outputLines: 3-8}
sudo ufw allow proto udp from 0.0.0.0/0 to any port 1194
sudo ufw status numbered
Status: active

     To                         Action      From
     --                         ------      ----
[ 1] 22/tcp                     ALLOW IN    Anywhere
[ 2] 1194/udp                   ALLOW IN    Anywhere
```

Instruct the firewall to allow routed traffic from the tunnel
network device to the main NIC with the following commands.

```bash {outputLines: 3-9}
sudo ufw route allow in on tun0 out on eth0
sudo ufw status numbered
Status: active

     To                         Action      From
     --                         ------      ----
[ 1] 22/tcp                     ALLOW IN    Anywhere
[ 2] 1194/udp                   ALLOW IN    Anywhere
[ 3] Anywhere on eth0           ALLOW FWD   Anywhere on tun0
```

Finally, network address translation rules need to be added to the
firewall. `ufw` does not support these rules with its command line
interface. As a result, we will add `iptables` rules to the
`/etc/ufw/before.rules` file. Place the following lines at the top of the
file and configure the source subnet to match the configuration of the OpenVPN
server.

```sh:title=/etc/ufw/before.rules {6}{numberLines: true}
# NAT table rules
*nat
:POSTROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]

# Forward traffic through eth0 - Change to match your out-interface
-A POSTROUTING -s 10.10.10.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

# don't delete the 'COMMIT' line or these nat table rules won't
# be processed
COMMIT
# End NAT table rules
```

Enable and disable the firewall to load the masquerade rules.

```bash
sudo ufw disable && sudo ufw enable
```

#### Configure the Server Network Security Group

In the final server configuration step, the Azure Network Security Group
associated with the VPN server network interface needs to be adjusted
to allow incoming traffic on the OpenVPN UDP port as well.

From the portal, navigate to the network security group resource. Select
**Settings** > **Inbound security rules** > **Add** to create an inbound
rule as shown below.

![Configure Network Security Group](./openvpn-server/configure-nsg.png)

### Configure the Client

With the server configuration running and in place, we need to create
a client configuration file. The client configuration needs to match
the features of the server configuration and then must be _**securely**_
transferred to the client device.

### Create the Client Configuration File

To create the client configuration file, we will need access to the
following files as created in earlier steps. The contents of each file
need to be copied into the various sections of the client
configuration template.

```sh
/etc/openvpn/ca.crt # Certificate authority public key
/etc/openvpn/ta.key # TLS Authentication Static Secret
/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/issued/home-client.crt # Client public key
/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/private/home-client.key # Client private key
```

The template below has been created to match the server configuration
from above. The creation of the client configuration should be performed
on the server to avoid the need to move the pre-shared secrets and keys.

```sh:title=client.ovpn
client

remote <SERVER DNS OR IP HERE> 1194
remote-cert-tls server

dev tun
proto udp
resolv-retry infinite
nobind

persist-key
persist-tun

auth SHA256
cipher AES-256-GCM
tls-timeout 30
tls-version-min 1.2
key-direction 1

verb 3

# Downgrade privileges after initialization (non-Windows only)
user nobody
group nogroup

<ca>
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
<PASTE SERVER CA CERTIFICATE HERE>
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
</ca>

<tls-auth>
-----BEGIN OpenVPN Static key V1-----
<PASTE TA KEY HERE>
-----END OpenVPN Static key V1-----
</tls-auth>

<cert>
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
<PASTE CLIENT CERTIFICATE HERE>
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
</cert>

<key>
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
<PASTE CLIENT KEY HERE>
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
</key>
```

A current version of this client configuration template is available
[here](https://github.com/jpfulton/example-linux-configs/blob/main/etc/openvpn/client.ovpn).

### Copy the Client Configuration File to a Local Machine

The next step in this process is to _**securely**_ copy the OpenVPN client
configuration from the server where it was created to a local machine. Use
[scp](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/en/man1/scp.1.html) to move
the file. The configuration file includes a private key and a shared static
key for use in the TLS authentication process.

When following this step, it is an excellent idea to ensure that your
macOS hard drive is encrypted via
[FileVault](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/encrypt-mac-data-with-filevault-mh11785/)
and that your iCloud account is end-to-end encrypted via
[Advanced Data Protection](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202303).

```bash
scp -i ~/.ssh/ubuntu-vpn-server_key.pem jpfulton@ubuntu-vpn-server.private.jpatrickfulton.com:/home/jpfulton/azure-personal-network.ovpn .
```

### Install the Configuration and Test a Client

With the client configuration downloaded to a local machine, one of several
OpenVPN clients can be configured and then tested.
[Ubuntu Desktop](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) includes an OpenVPN client.
Additionally,
[Tunnelblick](https://tunnelblick.net)
may be used on macOS and
[OpenVPN Connect](https://openvpn.net/client/client-connect-vpn-for-windows/) may be
used on Windows.

In the <Link to="/blog/2023-07-21-azure-personal-network-vpn-firewalla/">next post</Link>,
I will discuss setting up the client configuration on a
[Firewalla](https://firewalla.com) device.

## Tear Down the Azure Virtual Network Gateway

With a replacement solution in place, the Azure Virtual Network Gateway
created in
the <Link to="/blog/2023-07-19-azure-personal-network-vpn-gateway/">earlier post</Link>
can be taken down and the associated resources removed.

### Remove the Virtual Network Gateway Resource

Navigate to the Virtual Network Gateway and select **Delete**.

![Remove Network Gateway](./remove-vpn-gateway/delete-vpn-gateway.png)

### Remove the Public IP

Find and delete the public IP that was associated with the network
gateway.

![Remove Public IP](./remove-vpn-gateway/delete-public-ip.png)

### Remove the Gateway Subnet from the Virtual Network

Navigate to the virtual network resource and remove the unused
gateway subnet.

![Remove Gateway Subnet](./remove-vpn-gateway/delete-gateway-subnet.png)
